It also supports constituent engagement and communication through the study on cancer prevalence and mortality among active duty aircrew. However, it may not directly address wildfire preparedness and prevention, which could be seen as a potential conflict.",

The study on cancer prevalence and mortality among active duty aircrew aligns with his goal of engaging with constituents and communicating important information. However, the law may not directly address wildfire preparedness and prevention, which could be seen as a potential area for improvement in alignment with all campaign objectives.",
