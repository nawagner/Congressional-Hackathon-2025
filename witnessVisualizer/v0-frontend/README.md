# Witness Visualizer Frontend Stub

This directory previously pointed to an external Git submodule and did not contain any tracked files. Because the upstream repository does not publish a `.gitmodules` entry for it, GitHub Actions attempted to initialize the submodule and failed with:

```
fatal: No url found for submodule path 'witnessVisualizer/v0-frontend' in .gitmodules
```

For now we leave a placeholder so CI and GitHub Pages builds succeed. If the full frontend source becomes available, replace this stub with the actual application (or reintroduce the submodule together with a `.gitmodules` entry).
