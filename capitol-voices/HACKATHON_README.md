# CapitolVoices: Real-Time Congressional Hearing Transcription & Analysis

## 🏛️ Congressional Hackathon 2025 Submission

**Problem Statement Addressed:** *"Both Congressional staff and the public would benefit from rapid access to Congressional hearing transcripts. The official transcripts are produced very meticulously before publication to ensure complete accuracy for the public record, but unfortunately this attention to detail requires a great deal of time. Now that we have access to Large Language Models (LLMs) and high-quality automated transcription, is it possible to automatically generate a transcript within minutes of the end of a hearing, rather than weeks or months?"*

- 🎤 **Speaker diarization & identification** - Automatically identify who's speaking using committee rosters
- 📝 **Timestamp-verified summaries** - Every bullet point cites verifiable timestamp spans
- 🔍 **Searchable transcripts** - Full-text search across all hearing content
- 📊 **Speaker-by-speaker analysis** - Organized insights by committee member
